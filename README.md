This is a demo quiz app.
The skeleton of the package is from the [React Slingshot starter kit](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot).

It uses a Golang based server adapted from the [Facebook React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html), and uses
HTTP + JSON to communicate.

Proper error handling is Not done, and the code is kind of hacky.
